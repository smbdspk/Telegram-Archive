"""Per-file parallel chunked media downloads (issue #183).

This module provides a *bytes-fetching primitive* that can replace
``TelegramClient.download_media`` at the existing download seam in
``telegram_backup.py``. It splits one file into fixed-size chunks fetched
concurrently over several independent MTProto senders to a single DC, then
reassembles them by writing each chunk at its exact byte offset.

Design constraints (issue #183, all enforced here):

1. **Gated by the caller.** This module never decides *whether* to run in
   parallel; the backup layer gates on a config flag and a size threshold and
   only constructs/uses :class:`ParallelDownloader` for large files. The
   primitive still falls back defensively (raising
   :class:`ParallelDownloadUnavailable`) when it cannot operate safely.
2. **Bounded, low sender count.** Concurrency is capped by ``connections``,
   which the config layer clamps well under Telegram's ~20-connection cliff.
3. **Single flood budget.** A chunk that hits ``FLOOD_WAIT`` cancels its
   siblings and re-raises the *original* :class:`FloodWaitError`, so the
   caller's ``call_with_flood_retry`` wrapper applies the one shared budget and
   restarts the whole transfer — there is no second backoff scheme here.
4. **Deterministic, verified reassembly.** Each chunk is written with
   ``os.pwrite`` at its exact request offset (no shared seek pointer), and
   before the file is accepted we assert the written byte ranges cover
   ``[0, file_size)`` exactly once, with no gaps or overlaps.
5. **Transactional.** Any chunk failure cancels siblings, closes every sender,
   deletes the partial output, and re-raises the original exception type so the
   caller's retry / ``FileReferenceExpired`` refresh logic is unchanged.
6. **Bounded memory.** Chunks stream straight to disk; peak resident bytes are
   roughly ``connections * part_size`` (default 4 * 512 KiB = 2 MiB).
